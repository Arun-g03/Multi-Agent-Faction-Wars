## 📝 NOTES

This release represents a fundamental transformation of the Multi-Agent Faction Wars from a simple task assignment system into a sophisticated AI system capable of emergent strategic intelligence. The system now provides true emergent behavior where HQ learns to understand the state and pick optimal strategies, while agents learn to follow orders but also act independently when plans deviate - much like real soldiers completing missions with tactical autonomy.

The hierarchical emergent learning system enables the development of novel strategies, complex coordination patterns, and adaptive behavior that emerges from the interaction between HQ strategic intelligence and agent tactical autonomy. This creates a sophisticated multi-agent system with both local and global intelligence, representing a significant advancement in AI research and game AI development.
